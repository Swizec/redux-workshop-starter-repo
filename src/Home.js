            This app uses the StubHub API to fetch a list of upcoming events in
            San Francisco. The events are searchable using Downshift. Clicking
            an event adds it to the shopping cart.
        </P>
        <P>
            The shopping cart can be checked out via a form built with
            redux-form. The form remembers your values for future purchases.
        </P>

            Past purchases are stored in a Redux form, but we only show a count
